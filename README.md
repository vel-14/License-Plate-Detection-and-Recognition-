# License-Plate-Detection-and-Recognition-
Detect and recognize vehicle license plates using YOLOv8 for precise detection and CRNN for accurate character recognition. This project leverages annotated datasets to train models for efficient vehicle image analysis and license plate identification. Achieved an evaluation accuracy of 0.8567 for character recognition using CRNN.
